    We did this project at the beginning of my senior year. This project was to make a webpage about ourselves including our: name, age, favorite color, siblings, etc. If you click on the div boxes, the color will change!

    This project was for a website design team competition. Our team placed third with our website! This website was made up of research for different topics of our choosing from a selected list.

    For this project we were allowed to make any kind of website we wanted. I decided to create a website that stated the roster and schedule for my hockey team.

    This is a bowling game, in which you use the left and right arrows to aim, and use the spacebar to "throw" the ball. My only error is after you throw your second ball, the spacebar needs to be pressed a second time to show "spare".

<h3>Plans For The Future</h3>
    <p>My plans for after highschool are to attend Owens Community College. The degree I am going to start with is Computer Programming Technology. Also, I am thinking about getting two certificates after I get my associates degree. The first one I am looking at is the website design certificate. Then the second certificate I am interested in is the CISCO certificate, which focuses on the security side of protecting websites.  Secondly, after that maybe I will get my bachelor's degree. I want to end up building websites, and focusing on the web design.
